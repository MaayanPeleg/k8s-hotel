# Kubernetes Deployement
## For Hotel Portal System
In this README I will explain the deployment of the Hotel Portal System on Kubernetes. The deployment is done using the Kubernetes YAML files. The YAML files are divided into 3 parts:
> - frontend
> - backend/API 
> - database

These were all coded in python using the flask framework.
